   ```
   - Deletes the specified VM instance.

8. **Viewing Logs:**
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=gce_instance" --limit=10
   ```
   - Reads the logs for Google Compute Engine instances.

9. **Creating a Cloud Storage Bucket:**
   ```bash
   gsutil mb gs://BUCKET_NAME
   ```
   - Creates a new Google Cloud Storage bucket.

10. **Uploading Files to Cloud Storage:**
    ```bash
    gsutil cp LOCAL_FILE_PATH gs://BUCKET_NAME/
    ```
    - Uploads a file to the specified Cloud Storage bucket.

11. **Listing Files in a Bucket:**
    ```bash
    gsutil ls gs://BUCKET_NAME/
    ```
    - Lists all files in the specified Cloud Storage bucket.

12. **Setting Bucket Permissions:**
    ```bash

     ```

2. **Using Kubernetes:**
   - **Setting Up a GKE Cluster:**
     ```bash
     gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME --zone=ZONE
     ```

3. **Monitoring and Billing:**
   - **Viewing Billing Reports:**
