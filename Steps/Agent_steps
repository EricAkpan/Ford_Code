# Allowing Ingestion for Running Agent

## Goal:
The Elastic Agent should be able to ingest logs efficiently.

## Steps:

### 1. Building Docker Image:
- **Error Encountered When Building Image:**
  - **Message:**
    ```
    ERRO[0001] did not get container create message from subprocess: EOF 
    ERRO[0000] retrieving list of mounts: read /proc/self/mountinfo: bad file descriptor 
    error running container: from /usr/bin/runc creating container for [/bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl tar tini]: time="2024-12-05T16:49:43-05:00" level=warning msg="unable to get oom kill count" error="no directory specified for memory.oom_control"
    time="2024-12-05T16:49:43-05:00" level=error msg="runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: \"/bin/sh\": stat /bin/sh: no such file or directory"
    : exit status 1
    Error: building at STEP "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl tar tini": while running runtime: exit status 1
    ```

  - **Solution:**
    1. **Wrong Approach:** Use your own scratch space, as it seems not to work in `cchamp1`.
    2. **Correct Approach:** Clear Docker images and cache due to mounting errors.
       - **Commands:**
         - `buildah images`
         - `buildah prune -a`


### 1. Add API Key to Config Map (DONE)
- **Try a different API key** instead of the one that caused the error.
  
- **Errors:**
  - **Failed Execution:**
    - **Message:** 
      - Failed: execution of component prevented: cannot be writable by group or others.

    - 
  
  - **Bad Request Error when Running Agent Again:**
    - **Message:**
      - `Error from server (BadRequest): container "elastic-agent-k8s" in pod "elastic-agent-k8s-5656f7f8cd-pbjbx" is waiting to start: ContainerCreating.`
    - **Solutions:**
      - Just had to rerun pod creatation

### 2. Change Permissions in Dockerfile
- Change the permissions of the elastic-agent folder in the Dockerfile.
  - Ensure that the folder is only readable and writable for the user and owner.

#### Attempts

1. Set User as cchamp1 & run agent commands as user
    - **Changes made:**
        - *Dockerfile*
            - Set User ID to be 1000

        -  *Manifest file*
            - Inside of security context set runAsUser = 1000
    - **Explaination**:
        - Because user has current process running you are not able to add existing user to the docker
        - K8s pod can run code as specific user id


### 3. Send sample log data from  Elastic-Agent Folder to ElasticSearch
- **Goals:** I need to be able to send test data to ElasticSearch index 
- **Errors**:
  - **Failed to connect** - Unable to send data

    ```bash
    Failed to connect to backoff(elasticsearch(http://127.0.0.1:9200)):
    Attempting to reconnect to backoff(elasticsearch(http://127.0.0.1:9200)) with 9 reconnect attempt(s)
    ```
- **Solution:**
  - Redeploy agent with using API key for beat and ensure that host host is ["https://6f1f5642f7524fdb931357af191b4186.psc.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243"]
  - Need to save the actual real yaml file somehow without secret and with secrets

    

### 4. Setup Test Logs
- Set up test logs in `cchamp1` for the agent to ingest.
- set the volume mount path to be `/s/cchamp1`
#### **Errors:**
  - Path is not allowed - Error
    - **Message**: 
      ```bash
      15m         Warning   FailedCreate         replicaset/elastic-agent-k8s-5cc5cc75bf                         Error creating: admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [psp-host-filesystem] violation1: - Hostpath {"hostPath": {"path": "/s/cchamp1/eakpan3/", "type": "Directory"}, "name": "app-logs"} is not allowed, POD: elastic-agent-k8s-5cc5cc75bf-txh79. Allowed Hostpath: /s/cchamp1/....
      ```
    - **Solution**:
      - Try just mounting the  `/s/cchamp1` path
      - **Question**: Does mountpath have to be the same as hostPath??

  - UID defined in container not allowed for namespace autonomy-mlops
    - **Message:**
      ```bash
      webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [psp-host-filesystem] violation12: UID defined in container {"1000"} not allowed for namespace autonomy-mlops. Allowed: {"2481571"}, Disallowed: {"1000"}
      ```
    - Solutions:
      - Only UID of cchamp1 is allowed to mount volume
        - so UID of deployment & container must be from cchamp1




### 5. Change Ownership of elastic-agent directory
- **Goal**:
  - You need to change the ownership of the elastic directory to be cchamp1 user 
    - UID = 2481571
- **Reasons**:
  - You cannot run elastic-agent without write permission ONLY to owner
  - UID must be 2481571 because you cannot mount volume with different UID

- **Errors:**
  - Cannot run pull tar via curl command
    - **Message**:
      ```bash
      Warning: Failed to create the file elastic-agent-8.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: 
      Warning: Permission denied
      curl: (23) Failed writing body (0 != 1369)
      ```
    - **Solution**:
      - Do not include curl pull inside `docker-entrypoint.sh`



### 6. Running Elastic Agent managed by Fleet in K8s
- **Goal**: 
  - You should be able to be to run Agent managed by Fleet for better user interactions within Kibana UI

- **Errors**:
  - Ignores Fleet envirnoment variables
    - Thoughts:
      - Tried setting Fleet environment variables from [Elastic Agent managed by Fleet](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/running-on-kubernetes-managed-by-fleet.html)
      - Doesn't use the Fleet variable for elasticsearch host url
    - Message: `Failed to connect to backoff(...`
    - Ideas:
      - Test if environment variable are actually being set
      - Add Fleet configuration to agent.yml via ConfigMap

  - Cannot run `elastic-agent install` without root permissions
    - So cannot add Fleet using the `install` command
